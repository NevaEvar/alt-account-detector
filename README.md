# alt-account-detector
The project is focused on getting started on a alt account detector for discord and also for having some base starting point for my Bachelors thesis. 
The main focus is simply learning more about text based prediction. Some of the assumptions in ResultAnalysis can be wrong and might be later corrected. 
Code quality is also low since full rewrites will be done later for bachelors thesis which will be it's own project. So accumilated technical debt is expected.
Implementation for the full discord bot will be done later after bachelor thesis completion and when the rewrite for the code is done for it. 

Model training program flows from TrainAndTest -> ModelToolkit -> ParseTxtToCsv
