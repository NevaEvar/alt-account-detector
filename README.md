# alt-account-detector
The project is focused on building a alt account detector for discord and also for having some base starting point for my Bachelors thesis so it could be considered as a throw away sprint project. 
The main focus is simply learning more. Some of the assumptions in ResultAnalysis can be wrong and might be later corrected. 
Code quality is also low since full rewrites will be done later for bachelors thesis which will be it's own project. So accumilated technical debt is expected.
