Trained the model with short one off message pairs. The messages were vectorized and cosine was used to find features. 
Data was should've been fairly balanced for both true and false and the data set was fairly small.

Improvements:
Extract some other feature from the vectors to account for different features? 

Instead of training the model on small phrases add up messages from same user into bigger texts. Rational: Same user usually has common phrases that they use often. Thus it would stand to reason that including more text would bring these phrases more visible for the model.

Balance the data more. Rational: Recall on "Is message from the same user? yes." is very good while the opposite is very bad.
